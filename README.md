# README

Members of the [OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/) 
TC create and manage technical content in this TC GitHub repository 
([https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-ap-lc](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-ap-lc)) as part of the 
TC's chartered work (**i.e.**, the program of work and deliverables described in its
[charter](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/charter.php).

OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in 
[GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work)
are governed by the OASIS [TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process), 
[IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), and other policies, 
similar to TC Wikis, TC JIRA issues tracking instances, TC SVN/Subversion repositories, etc.  
While they make use of public GitHub repositories, these TC GitHub repositories are distinct from 
[OASIS Open Repositories](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories), which are 
used for development of open source licensed content.

## Description

This repository is for a log collector actuator profile.

Actuator profiles identify the aspects of the OpenC2 language specification that are
mandatory and/or meaningful in the context of a given actuator. Actuator Profiles also 
identify specifiers and options that are unique to the actuator. 

This repository will focus on the use of OpenC2 to issue commands to and
parse responses from systems that generate events such as system log, application
log, or error log messages.
